         The sole programming assignment for this course will be submitted through the 
         <a href="https://git.ucsc.edu/users/sign_in"><b>UCSC GitLab</b></a> server. &nbsp;
         If you are new to GitLab, some introductory material can be found at the 
         <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/gitlab/"><b>ITS GitLab for Instruction</b></a> page.
         &nbsp;
         You may also read the following

         <b>introduction to GitLab</b></a>
         on YouTube, and some helpful documentation pages 
         <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/"><b>here</b></a> and 
         <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html"><b>here</b></a> 
         that introduce command line tools for Git. &nbsp;Note that these tutorials describe interaction with the (free) cloud services 
         <a href="https://gitlab.com/"><b>GitLab.com</b></a> 
         or 
         <a href="https://github.com/"><b>GitHub.com</b></a>, 
         whereas you will submit your code to 
         <a href="https://git.ucsc.edu/users/sign_in"><b>UCSC GitLab</b></a>. &nbsp;
         If you don't want to learn about Git command line tools, it is also possible to log in to 
         <a href="https://git.ucsc.edu/users/sign_in"><b>UCSC GitLab</b></a>, then upload and edit files directly through your web browser.<br>

         Go to 
         <a href="https://github.com/patricktantalo/CSE-102-Project-Resources">https://github.com/patricktantalo/CSE-102-Project-Resources</a> 
         and download the file <b>Check</b>. &nbsp;This is a Linux binary executable file that will allow you to verify the validity of an input/output file pair. &nbsp;It will work on the 
         <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/unix-timeshare/index.html">Unix Timeshare</a> 
         (and likely on any Linux command line environment.) &nbsp;Make it executable by typing <b>chmod 700 Check</b> at the unix command prompt, then run it by typing <b>Check input-file output-file</b>. &nbsp;It is imperative that you test your project thoroughly on a Linux environment since that is how it will be evaluated by the grader. &nbsp;If you are totally unfamiliar with Unix command line tools, and with the timeshare, read 
         <a href="https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps012b/Summer19/lab1.pdf">Lab Assignment 1</a>
         from my CMPS 12B Summer 2019. &nbsp;The above GitHub repository also contains a number of valid input/output file pairs that you may use for testing. &nbsp;(Keep in mind that multiple output files may be valid for one and the same input file.) &nbsp;The above GitHub repository does not (but may eventually) contain a random input file generator.

         Perform the following steps to submit your project.<br>

         <ol>

            <li>
               Create an account on 
               <a href="https://git.ucsc.edu/users/sign_in">UCSC GitLab</a>. &nbsp;
               I will run a script once a day for the first two weeks of class that will create your repository. &nbsp; Note that I cannot create a repository for you until you have an account, which is why I run the script once a day. &nbsp;You may therefore have to wait up to 24 hours before you see your repo on the server.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Create a directory called "project" in your GitLab repository. &nbsp;This is where you will place your solution to this programming assignment.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
               Submit your source files (described in the pdf above) to the "project" directory in your repo. &nbsp;You may submit subsequent versions of your program (i.e. add, commit &amp; push) as many times as you like. &nbsp;We will grade the last commit made before the due date. &nbsp;Later commits will not be considered for grading. &nbsp;Please include only project source code files. &nbsp;In particular, do not include the Check program.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
               If you have trouble with any of these instructions, please see a TA (or me) for help.<br>
            </li>
            <br>
