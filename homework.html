      <br>

      Written homework assignments will be submitted and reviewed via 
      <a href="https://www.crowdgrader.org/">CrowdGrader</a>. &nbsp;Begin by creating 
      an account on CrowdGrader with user name identical to your <b>CruzID@ucsc.edu</b> 
      email address. &nbsp;For each homework assignment, perform the following steps.

      <br>

      <ul>

         <li>
            Work all problems carefully and neatly. &nbsp;You may write your solutions by hand, 
            or you may use a text editor. &nbsp;CrowdGrader includes an editor supporting
            mathematical notation. &nbsp;Note that neatness and readability will count 
            towards your grade. &nbsp;<b>Do not include your name or identifying information on your
            homework paper.</b> We will identify you through your CrowdGrader account name.
         </li>

         <br>

         <li>
            Scan your paper as a pdf file.&nbsp; There are many free scanner apps available for 
            both iPhone and Android.&nbsp; Some recommended scanners are: 

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
               
               <br>
               
               <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188">
               Evernote Scannable</a> for iOS devices, and<br>
               <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free&amp;hl=en_US">
               Genius Scan</a> for Android devices.<br>

               <br>

            </div>

            If you use the CrowdGrader editor, no scan will be necessary.    
         </li>

         <br>

         <li>
            The submission period will last <u>2 days</u> (Monday, Tuesday), 
            and the assignment will be visible in your CrowdGrader account during that 
            time.&nbsp; Upload your pdf before the deadline by following the submission
            link. 
         </li>

         <br>

         <li>
            The review period will begin after solutions are posted, and will last 
            <u>5 days</u> (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).&nbsp; CrowdGrader 
            will present you with the papers of 5 randomly selected students.&nbsp; 
            Use the posted solutions, together with the CrowdGrader rubric, to 
            evaluate these papers.&nbsp; The rubric will consist of three catagories:
            neatness, completeness and correctness. 
         </li>

         <br>

         <li>
            You will receive two grades, one based on your homework submission (your <em><b>submission
            grade</b></em>), and the other based on your accuracy as a reviewer (your <em><b>review
            grade</b></em>).&nbsp; These grades will be combined (80% submission grade + 20% review
            grade) to give your <em><b>crowdgrade</b></em>, which will be your score on the assignment.  
         </li>

         <br>

         <li>
